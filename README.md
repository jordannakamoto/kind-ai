Kind – AI Therapy Check-In

Kind is a voice-based therapy check-in application that helps users reflect, gain insights, and feel supported through structured, AI-guided conversations. It combines real-time voice interaction, personalized therapy content, and post-session feedback to provide a meaningful and accessible mental health tool.

Overview

Kind allows users to speak with an AI assistant trained to listen, reflect, and offer helpful perspectives. After each session, the system generates a transcript, a brief summary, and three types of therapist-style feedback: insights, challenges, and suggested next steps. The app also tracks themes, goals, and a working profile to help users stay aware of their growth over time.

Core Features

How It Works
	1.	The user presses “Start Check-In” to begin a voice-based session with the AI.
	2.	The conversation flows naturally. The system listens and responds with empathy, insight, and guidance.
	3.	After the session ends, the system processes the transcript, extracts key points, and stores a summary.
	4.	The app generates feedback: a brief insight, a gentle challenge to current assumptions, and suggested next steps.
	5.	These results update the user’s profile and inform future sessions.

Purpose

Kind is not meant to replace a human therapist. Instead, it provides a consistent, structured space for users to check in with themselves, reflect, and receive helpful feedback. It is designed for daily or weekly use as part of a broader mental health routine.
